                       Parse::Lex.pm - V 1.12

The Parse::Lex.pm module for perl5 is an object-oriented generator of
lexical analysers.

Parse::Lex.pm is currently under development but perfectly usable
(IMHO). Documentation is in French. It's not a linguistic provocation!
I am very busy, and I've no time to translate it in English (and I
know that the result will not be perfect ;-).

If you think Parse::Lex is an unvaluable tool or I'm wasting my
time on an useless project, let me know!
