                       Parse::Lex.pm - 1.13
___________
DESCRIPTION

The Parse::Lex.pm module for perl5 is an object-oriented generator of
lexical analysers.

Parse::Lex.pm is currently under development but perfectly usable
(IMHO). Documentation is in French. It's not a linguistic provocation!
I am very busy, and I've no time to translate the documentation in
English (and I know that the result will not be perfect ;-).

A collection of examples demonstrating various Parse::Lex features and
techniques are in the directory "examples".

If you think Parse::Lex is an unvaluable tool or I'm wasting my
time on an useless project, let me know!
